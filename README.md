# SerialTrackball

Arduino project for reading data from a serial trackball mouse.

In this implementation, the serial data is also converted into a mouse data packet for transmitting to a Adafruit Bluefruit EZ-Key (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1535), but this is not necessarily the only application. One other option I can think of is using a serial mouse/trackball on an Arduino-powered robot for dead-rekoning/positioning applications.
